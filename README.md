## Building a Real-Time Twitter Sentiment Analysis Web App with Python and Flask


Sentiment Analysis on Twitter(X) Data with DevOps Implementation

`Context of the project:`
This project involves understanding the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in Twitter messages. I'll explore basic natural language processing (NLP) techniques and gain insights into public opinion on a specific topic.

### What is Sentiment Analysis?

- Sentiment analysis is a context-based mining of text which extracts and identifies subjective information from the text or sentence provided.

- It is the most common text classification technique that analysises an incoming text and interprets whether the underlying sentiment is positive negative or neutral.

### A brief intro to flask

- Flask is a python-based micro web open-source framework which doesn't require particular tools or libraries. So flask doesn't have any form validation data abstraction layer or any other components as such but throuch third-party libraries or extensions you can add various features like form validation, upload hanlder and various other functions.

- So I'm using a bootstrap framewokr as well here in conjuction with flask to use HTML based elements like a drop-down, buttons, checkboxes, JavaScript so and so forth to make my webpage more responsive.
- Bootstrap is again a free and open-source CSS framework which is very helpful in building responsive mobile first front-end web application.

- Here i picked a ready-made template from `bootsnap.com`
